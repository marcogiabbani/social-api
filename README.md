# Multi collecitons manager

The idea is to create a pretty complete login only for an administrator.
This user will be able to create different collections with different sections (Title, text, data, photos).
Then retrieve the collections with pagination.
Photos will be stores in local directory.

This will serve as an API to Portfolio custom websites.
